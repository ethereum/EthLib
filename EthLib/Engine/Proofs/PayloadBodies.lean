# Proofs: `engine_getPayloadBodiesByHash` and `engine_getPayloadBodiesByRange`

A request is too large exactly when it asks for more bodies than the node takes.

So a request of at most 32 bodies is never too large.

The withdrawals of a body are `null` exactly for a block before Shapella.

Its block access list is `null` exactly for a block before Glamsterdam, or when it was pruned.

By hash, an answer has one entry per requested hash, in order.

Each entry is the body that the store holds for its hash, or `null` where it holds none.

By range, a request with `start` or `count` at 0 is invalid, whatever the store.

`start` is checked first, so a request with both at 0 fails on `start`.

An answer has `count` entries, or fewer when the range passes the latest known block.

Entry `i` is the body of canonical block `start + i`, which is at most the latest known block.

When the range reaches the latest known block, the last entry is that block's entry.

The store holds the body of that block, so the entry is not `null`.

A range that starts past the latest known block has an empty answer.

The decoders read back the parameters that the writers write.

A body reads back from its JSON at its version, and so does each answer.

The withdrawals and the access list come back as `null` where they were `null`.
