# `Consensus.RelayApi`

What a relay keeps from the blocks that builders submit, and the bid that it serves from one.

A new submission replaces the previous one with the same builder key, even when it is worth less.

The [submission endpoint] states this rule.

The rule names no slot, so a store here holds the submissions for one slot, and ignores others.

From Bellatrix to Fulu, the relay serves the header of the payload as a bid of the Builder API.

From Deneb the bid carries the commitments to the blobs, by the [Deneb relaying rules].

From Electra it also carries the requests of the submission, by the [Electra bid].

A relay lists for builders the registered proposers of the current and next epoch.

Each entry holds a slot, the index of its proposer and its signed registration: [`responses.yaml`].

A slot whose proposer has no registration has no entry, by [`validators.yaml`].

The source says "scheduled to propose", but not how a relay learns that schedule.

So the rule here holds for any schedule, and from Fulu the lookahead gives one: [EIP-7917].

The data API lists the [delivered payloads] and the [received bids].

Their entries have the types of [`bids.yaml`].

A filter keeps the entries whose fields equal each value that it gives.

The limit and the cursor of a query are not modelled here.

The JSON of a received bid is that of its bid, plus the two timestamps as strings.

This library writes each timestamp in decimal, as the example of [`misc.yaml`] does.

Delivered payloads may also be sorted by value, lowest or highest first, as [`misc.yaml`] says.
