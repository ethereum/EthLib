# `Consensus.BeaconApi.Rewards`

The answers of the Beacon API that split the rewards of validators into their parts.

The [attestation rewards] of an epoch give, for each validator, what each kind of vote earned.

They are read from the state at the end of the next epoch, whose previous epoch is the one asked.

The epoch transition first updates justification and, from Altair, the inactivity scores.

Each part is then the reward minus the penalty that the transition computes for that kind.

Before Altair the inclusion part leaves out the shares that a proposer earns for including votes.

The ideal rewards give the same parts for a validator that voted right and in time.

The [sync committee rewards] of a block give, for each member, what its seats earned or paid.

They are read from the state that the sync aggregate step of the block reads.

The [block rewards] give what the proposer of a block earned in it, by the kind of item that paid.

Each other part is the rise of the proposer's balance in the step of the block that pays it.

The sync aggregate part is the proposer's share of each signature, which the step computes.

The response [types] fix the fields of each answer.

SOUNDNESS.md records the points that the source leaves open.

/-- What each kind of vote earned for each named validator in the previous epoch of a state.

The state is the one that the rewards step of the epoch transition reads.

From Altair the parts are the deltas of the three flags, in the order the transition applies them.

Before Altair they are the deltas of the source, target and head votes.

The inclusion part is then the attester's own part of the inclusion deltas.

The inactivity part is the penalty of the inactivity deltas, which hold no reward.

An empty request names every validator; an identifier that names none gives no entry. -/
