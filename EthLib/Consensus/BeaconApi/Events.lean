# `Consensus.BeaconApi.Events`

The events that a beacon node sends on its [event stream], and how the stream writes them.

A client subscribes to a list of topics, and receives only the events of those topics.

Each event is a message of a [server-sent event] stream: its topic, then its data as JSON.

The events of objects that the node received and the events of the fork choice share these types.
