# `Consensus.BeaconApi.Publish`

What a beacon node answers to a block or a payload envelope that a client asks it to publish.

The client picks a level of checks that the object must pass before the node broadcasts it.

The gossip checks of its topic run at every level, since a success means that they passed.

The consensus level adds the checks of the object, with its signatures, against the state before.

For a block, the execution layer checks the hashes of a payload and its empty transactions.

It gives no verdict on the payload itself.

For an envelope, it gives its verdict too.

The highest level also refuses an object whose block has a rival in the store.

A rival is another block of the same slot and the same proposer.

An object that fails its level is refused and not broadcast, and the node keeps its state.

Otherwise the node broadcasts it, then integrates it into the fork choice store, or fails to.

The [block endpoint] and the [envelope endpoint] give the levels and the three answers.

SOUNDNESS.md records how this module reads the points that the source leaves open.

/-- The answer to an object to publish, the store after it and the messages seen after it.

The node checks the gossip message of the object, then the later checks of the level.

A refused object leaves the store and the messages seen as they were.
