# `Consensus.BeaconApi.Committees`

The answers of the Beacon API that list the committees of a state.

The [committees] endpoint lists the beacon committees of an epoch, with filters on index and slot.

The [sync committees] endpoint gives the indices of a sync committee, and its slices.

From Gloas, the [PTC] endpoint gives the payload timeliness committee of a slot.

Each answer is computed from the state alone.

The flags `execution_optimistic` and `finalized` come from the store, not from the state.

SOUNDNESS.md records the points that the source leaves open.

A slot of the epoch matches when the slot filter is absent or names it.

The indices of a slot are those below its count of committees.

An index matches when the index filter is absent or names it.

The committees share one shuffle of the active validators of the epoch.

It fails when a slot of the epoch overflows 64 bits, or as the shuffle or a cut does. -/

/-- The response of the committees endpoint, without the two flags that come from the store.

The epoch is that of the state when none is given, and it must be at most the next one.

Its seed must read a RANDAO mix that the state still holds.

So the epoch plus the length of the buffer of mixes must be after the next one plus the lookahead.

An epoch outside these bounds, or a slot filter outside the epoch, gives the error with code 400.

An index filter only restricts the list, so an index that names no committee gives an empty list.

A committee that cannot be computed gives the error with code 500. -/
