# Proofs: what a relay keeps from a submission, and the bid it serves

A submission for the slot of a store replaces the entry of its builder, whatever the values.

No other entry changes, and a submission for another slot changes nothing.

The served bid holds the header, the value, the key and, from Deneb, the commitments of the bundle.

A blinded body that carries the header of that bid unblinds with the payload of the submission.

The JSON that the writer gives for a delivered payload reads back as that payload.

So does the JSON of a received bid, whose reader takes the two timestamps out first.

A filter with no field keeps every entry.

A filter with only a slot keeps exactly the entries of that slot.

A sort by value orders the payloads that it is given, and keeps them all.

From Fulu, each entry of the listed validators names the proposer of its slot.

That proposer is the one that the state gives once the slots of the transition reach that slot.
