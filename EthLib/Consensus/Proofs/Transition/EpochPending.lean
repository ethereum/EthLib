# Proofs: the pending deposits of an epoch

The pending deposits of an epoch keep one balance for each validator.

The queue never grows.

A pass never credits more inside the churn than the churn available.

A pass reads a prefix of the queue, applies some of it in order, and postpones the others.

So the queue splits into the deposits added to the balances, those dropped, and the queue after.

The balances plus the amounts in the queue never rise.

From Gloas, the churn of deposits is the churn of activations alone.

/-- The pending deposits of an epoch end with a pass over the queue from its front.

The pass reads the next epoch and the churn available.

That churn is the churn left from the last epoch and the churn of deposits.

It stops at a deposit that waits for the first slot of the finalized epoch.

The registry and the balances are those of the pass.

The queue holds the deposits that the pass did not reach, then those it postponed. -/
