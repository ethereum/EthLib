# Proofs: the epoch transition succeeds from Electra

From Electra the epoch also drains the queues of deposits and consolidations.

From Fulu it moves the lookahead of proposers.

From Gloas it pays builders and moves the window of payload timeliness committees.

From Heze it skips the reset of the deposit votes.

The supply and the size of the registry stay bounded from the start, so the draws can succeed.

Each draw also needs a validator at its cap, which the steps take as an assumption.

/-- From Electra, the epoch transition succeeds under bounds on the state.

The vectors of slashed balances and of mixes are not empty.

The divisors of the preset and the configuration are positive.

The block roots reach the previous epoch, and the hysteresis bands fit.

The rewards fit for the budget and an inactivity bound plus the bias.

The ceiling on the balances after the rewards is below `2^63`.

The products of the draws fit in 64 bits.

The seed lookahead is shorter than the history of mixes, and a sync committee is not empty.

The step runs at the last slot of an epoch.

The slot plus the slots of the history of roots fits in 64 bits.

The current epoch plus the seed lookahead, one and the length of the mixes fits in 64 bits.

The first slot of the epoch two past the seed lookahead is at most `2^64`.

The validators plus the pending deposits are within the limit of the registry.

There is one balance, one flag set and one score per validator.

Each effective balance is at most the largest one its credentials allow.

The sum of the effective balances is at most the budget.

That sum plus one increment, times three, fits in 64 bits.

Each balance is at most the budget.

Each inactivity score is at most that bound, and that bound plus the bias fits in 64 bits.

The total active balance and the balance behind each flag of the previous epoch are computed.

No flag of the previous epoch was set by more balance than is active now.

That is an assumption, not a consequence of validity, and the issuance bound needs it.

The balances plus the pending deposits plus the issuance bound are below `2^63`.

The checkpoints are in order, and the current justified epoch is at most the previous epoch.

An epoch bounds the first activation epoch, the end of the exit queue and every finite exit epoch.

That epoch plus the cost of the unstarted exits and the withdrawability delay is below `2^64 - 1`.

The least churn and the largest shared churn are each at least one increment.

The churn carried for exits plus three times its ceiling fits in 64 bits.

The churn carried for deposits plus its cap fits in 64 bits.

Both indices of every queued consolidation are in the registry.

The slashed balances fit, and so does their sum times the multiplier.

The current epoch plus half the length of the vector of slashed balances fits too.

The list of history summaries has room for one more.

From Gloas an epoch has at least six slots.

The least balance to activate is at most the cap of a compounding validator.

The validators plus the pending deposits number at most `2^40`.

That number times the size of a sync committee fits in 64 bits.

From Gloas, so does that number times the size of a payload committee.

From Gloas, so does it times one more than the committees per slot, times the slots of an epoch.

When the next epoch starts a sync committee period, take the state reached before that draw.

Every key of that state must pass validation.

That state must also hold a validator at the cap, active in the next epoch.

The other two draws are for the epoch one past the seed lookahead.

From Fulu the state that the lookahead step reads must hold a validator at the cap, active then.

From Gloas that validator must also be unslashed.

From Gloas, the state the window step reads needs a validator at the cap in each slot of that epoch.

That validator must be a member of the beacon committees of that slot.

Those validators at the cap let each draw stop; validity does not give them, so they are assumed. -/
