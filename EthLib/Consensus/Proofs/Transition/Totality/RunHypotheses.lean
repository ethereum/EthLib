# Proofs: the hypotheses that a run of slots takes on the states it reaches

A run of slots succeeds under bounds that each epoch keeps, and under three more hypotheses.

They are not consequences of the bounds, so a run takes them as assumptions.

The first bounds the signers of the first two epochs by the total active balance.

A validator that exits at the epoch boundary still counts as a signer but is not active.

The run applies no block, so from the third epoch no one has signed and the bound holds.

The second is on the draws of committees and proposers.

A draw is certain to end when it meets a validator at the cap of its fork.

The validators at the cap can leave or lose balance during the run, so their presence is assumed.

It is assumed once per epoch, and from Gloas in each slot of the epoch for the payload committee.

The same hypothesis carries the condition of the upgrade to Heze: its two deposit indices are equal.

The third bounds the epochs of a run that starts before Altair.

Before Altair, the inactivity penalty grows with the epochs since the last finality.

It fits when the epoch is at most a limit, about `9 * 10^6` epochs on mainnet.

A run that stays before Altair on a quiet state meets all three, since nothing is drawn there.

That shows only that the three are consistent, not that the draws from Altair can be met.

/-! ## The draws at the cap -/

/-- The draws of an epoch transition stop at a validator at the cap, at the states they read.

Each draw reads the state that the stages before it reach.

From Altair, when the next epoch starts a sync committee period, a new committee is drawn.

Every key of the state it reads must then pass validation.

That state must also hold a validator at the cap, active in the next epoch.

From Fulu, the proposers of the epoch one past the seed lookahead are drawn.

The state that step reads must hold a validator at the cap, active then, and unslashed from Gloas.

From Gloas, the payload committees of the slots of that epoch are drawn.

In each slot, one member of the beacon committees must be at the cap. -/

/-- The draws of the upgrade from the fork of a state stop at a validator at the cap.

The upgrade to Altair draws a sync committee.

Every key must pass validation, and a validator at the cap must be active in the next epoch.

The upgrade to Fulu draws the proposers of the epochs up to the seed lookahead.

In each such epoch a validator at the cap must be active.

The upgrade to Gloas draws the payload committees of the slots of those epochs.

In each slot, one member of the beacon committees must be at the cap.

The upgrade to Heze also needs its two deposit indices equal, which no draw gives. -/
