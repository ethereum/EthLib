# Proofs: the upgrades keep the bounds of a run of slots

An upgrade keeps the slot, so it counts no epoch, and the bounds of a run keep their parameters.

Most upgrades carry the fields that the bounds read.

The upgrade to Altair starts the inactivity scores at zero.

The upgrade to Electra moves balances into pending deposits, and zeroes some effective balances.

So the supply stays, and the sum of the effective balances can only fall.

It opens the exit queue one past the latest exit and the first activation epoch.

The exit ceiling allows that when it covers the first activation epoch.

The upgrade to Gloas can only remove pending deposits, when it funds builders from them.
