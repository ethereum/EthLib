# Proofs: the upgrades of the beacon state succeed under bounds

The upgrade to Altair turns the pending attestations into flags and draws the sync committee.

It succeeds when those attestations read and the draw has its bounds and assumptions.

The upgrade to Electra starts the churns of exits and consolidations, and the queue of deposits.

It succeeds under bounds on the registry, the epoch and the deposit queue.

The upgrade to Fulu computes the first lookahead of proposers, and fails only if that draw fails.

[EIP-7917] specifies that lookahead.

The upgrade to Gloas computes the first window of payload timeliness committees.

It then moves the pending deposits of builders to a new registry of builders.

[EIP-7732] specifies that onboarding at the fork, and [EIP-8282] keeps it.

The onboarding overflows no builder balance when the pending deposits hold under `2^64` Gwei.

The checks of the deposit signatures and the root of the empty requests never fail.

The bounds of each draw are stated on the state before the upgrade.

The upgrade keeps the registry, the mixes and the slot, so the draws read the same values.

/-- The upgrade to Fulu succeeds when the first lookahead of proposers can be drawn.

It draws the proposers of the current epoch and of each epoch of the seed lookahead.

In each of these epochs one active validator is at the cap of the draw.

That is an assumption on the registry, not a bound.

The bounds are those of the first lookahead, read on the Electra state. -/

The registry must have one balance for each validator.

The effective balances must sum below `2^64`, for the churns.

The first epoch at which an exit can start, plus one, must be below `2^64`.

Each validator queues at most two pending deposits, so twice the registry must fit in that queue.

That bound is not tight, since a validator queued before activation has no excess left.

The end of the exit queue needs no bound: a finite exit epoch is below the far future epoch. -/
