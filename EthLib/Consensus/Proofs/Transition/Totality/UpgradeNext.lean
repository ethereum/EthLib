# Proofs: each upgrade to the next fork succeeds under its conditions

The upgrade from each fork to the next has a totality theorem under its own conditions.

The upgrades to Bellatrix, Capella and Deneb only carry fields, so they never fail.

The upgrade to Heze succeeds exactly when the two deposit indices are equal.

The upgrades due at a slot then succeed when a property of states holds at the start.

Each due upgrade must succeed from a state with the property, and keep it.

Before Altair, a run of slots that ends two epochs later clears the pending attestations.

One epoch moves the list of the current epoch to the previous one, and starts an empty list.

So two epochs later both lists are empty, and the upgrade to Altair has none to translate.
