# `Execution.Rpc.Proof`

The answer of `eth_getProof`, in [`state.yaml`][state], and its JSON form.

The node answers with the proof of an account, and of some of its slots, in the state after a block.

The block parameter is optional, and `latest` by default.

The fields of the answer are those of the [`AccountProof` schema][schema].

An address is 20 bytes of hex, a nonce a 64-bit number, and a balance or a word a quantity.

The writer does not bound the nonce, so the reader takes back only a nonce below `2^64`.

A code hash or a storage root is 32 bytes, and each node of a proof a byte string.

A storage key has at most 64 hex digits, as the `bytesMax32` type of the schema allows.

The reader takes a key as a number on 32 bytes.

The answer writes each key as a quantity, without leading zeros.

The fixture `get-account-proof-with-storage.io` asks for the key `0x00` and expects `0x0`.

The schema allows both forms, and no text fixes the form of the echo.

The answer writes the address in lower case, as the fixtures do.

A trie of the state that the node cannot encode gets `-32603`.

The source does not bound how far back a node serves proofs.

Here it serves them at every block that it holds.
