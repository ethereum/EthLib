# `Execution.Rpc.Submit`

The method `eth_sendRawTransaction` of [`submit.yaml`][submit]: it submits a signed transaction.

Its parameter is the raw form of the transaction, and its result is the hash of the transaction.

The raw form of a blob transaction is its network form, with its blobs, commitments and proofs.

The source says so for EIP-4844, with its KZG proofs, and for EIP-7594, with cell proofs.

It also says that a node rejects cell proofs before the PeerDAS fork of EIP-7594.

That fork is Fusaka.

From Fusaka, the source says that a node "may" still accept proofs per blob and convert them.

The conversion computes the cell proofs of each blob, and the source calls it expensive.

This method takes the choice that the word "may" leaves, and rejects that form from Fusaka.

The hash is that of the transaction alone, without its blobs, commitments and proofs.

Which transactions a pool keeps is the choice of the node, and the source does not fix it.

Here the pool accepts each transaction that passes these checks:

- its raw form decodes at the fork of the next block;
- the counts of its blobs, commitments and proofs match, and each commitment has its hash;
- the inclusion checks pass in the next block, against the state of the head.

The next block is taken one second after the head, its earliest time, as in the fee history.

Its fork, base fees and blob schedule are those that the fee history gives it.

So in the last slot before a fork by time, a transaction is decoded at the fork before it.

Its gas limit is that of the head, and no transaction runs before this one.

A nonce above that of the sender is a future transaction, which a pool may keep for later.

So the checks read the state of the head with the nonce of the sender raised to that nonce.

A nonce below that of the sender still fails.

These checks do not verify the KZG proofs yet.

A raw form that does not decode, or whose blobs do not match its counts or hashes, gets `-32000`.

A failed inclusion check gets the code of the error groups that names its condition.

A failed inclusion check that no code names gets `-32003`, "Transaction rejected".

/-- The code of the error groups that names the condition of a failed inclusion check, if any.

The code 800 says "Intrinsic gas too low / Intrinsic gas exceeds gas limit".

A gas limit of a transaction below its intrinsic gas, or below the floor of EIP-7623, gets 800.

An intrinsic gas above the cap of EIP-7825 gets no code, since that cap is not a gas limit.

The method checks a transaction with no gas used before it in the block.

So the gas allowance of the block is exceeded exactly when the gas limit is above the block's.

That is the condition of 803.

The cost behind 809 also counts the blob gas at its fee cap, beyond "gas * price + value". -/
