# `Exports.Rpc`

The C exports of the parameter readers of the execution JSON-RPC API, and of its error codes.

A parameter crosses as the typed value of its JSON, with the name of its schema.

The names are those of [`base-types.yaml`][types] and [`block.yaml`][block].

A number or a `byte` reads as an `int`, and a byte string, an address or a hash as `bytes`.

A `bytes` value has an even number of digits, though the pattern of the source admits an odd one.

A value that holds Python `bytes` at any depth has no JSON form, so every schema rejects it.

A storage slot of type `bytesMax32` reads as its 32 bytes.

A block parameter reads as a tuple: its kind, then its number, its tag, or its hash and flag.

A value that its schema rejects has the code of invalid parameters, without its sign.

A chain view crosses as the inputs that build it, and answers a list of requests at once.

Its blocks are the lowest block and the blocks after it, each with the name of its fork.

Each block after the lowest runs through the state transition, as a valid view asks.

An unknown schema, or an argument that Lean cannot read, has code 0.

An error code may be negative, but a Python `int` crosses only when it is not.

So a code crosses as a pair: whether it is negative, then its absolute value.

/-- Answer requests of the execution JSON-RPC API from the chain that the arguments build.

The arguments are the configuration, the state of the lowest block, and the blocks.

Each block is the name of its fork and its RLP form, the lowest block first.

Then come the head, safe and finalized hashes, the network ID, and whether to check the seal.

Next come the block numbers whose access lists are pruned, while their blocks remain available.

From Glamsterdam, the access-list methods report code 4444 for a pruned list.

The last argument is the list of the texts of the requests.

The configuration may give `mergeForkBlock`, the `FORK_NEXT_VALUE` of EIP-3675.

When the lowest block is not block zero, `eth_config` needs `genesisHash` and `genesisTime` there.

When it is block zero, both are read from it, and any given values must match.

It returns the text of the response to each request, in order, or none for a notification.

A block that does not decode or fails its transition has the code of its block error.

Any other bad input has code 0. -/
