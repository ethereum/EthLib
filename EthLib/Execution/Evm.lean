# `EthLib.Execution.Evm`

The Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each instruction is the word it pushes, as a function of the words it pops, in the order it pops them.

KECCAK256 reads bytes from memory instead, so it is the word it pushes, as a function of those bytes.

The precompiled contracts are here too, because only the EVM calls them.

`Words` counts the 32-byte EVM words that cover a byte length, and the price of a precompile can grow with that count.

The stack, the memory, the gas and the program counter are not here yet.
