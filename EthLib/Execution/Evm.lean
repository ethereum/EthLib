The Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each instruction is the word it pushes, as a function of the words it pops, in the order it pops them.

KECCAK256 reads bytes from memory instead, so it is the word it pushes, as a function of those bytes.

The stack, the memory, the gas and the program counter are not here yet.
