# `EthLib.Execution.Evm`

The Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Each instruction is the word it pushes, as a function of the words it pops, in the order it pops them.

KECCAK256 reads bytes from memory instead, so it is the word it pushes, as a function of those bytes.

The precompiled contracts are here too, because only the EVM calls them.

The gas prices and the price of memory are here.

The stack, the memory itself, the gas meter and the program counter are not here yet.
